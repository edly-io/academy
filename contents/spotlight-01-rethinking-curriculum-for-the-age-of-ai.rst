**Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming education**—not just by changing how we teach, but by challenging what we teach.In this in-depth conversation, **Charles Fadel**, Founder and Chairman of the `Center for Curriculum Redesign <https://curriculumredesign.org/>`__, reflects on the implications of AI for learners, educators, and institutions. He raises a fundamental question: If AI can perform most tasks, what should humans focus on learning?
The discussion covers:

- The evolving role of curricula in an AI-saturated world
- The importance of ethics in engineering and education
- How AI is shaping the way we think, not just what we know
- Rethinking assessment, university entrance requirements, and the purpose of formal education

This conversation offers valuable perspectives for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers seeking to navigate the challenges and opportunities AI presents across the educational landscape.Learn more about Charles Fadel's work and his book `“Education for the Age of AI” <https://curriculumredesign.org/our-work/education-for-the-age-of-ai/>`__...
