Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming educationâ€”not just by changing how we teach, but by challenging what we teach.

In this in-depth conversation, Charles Fadel, Founder and Chairman of the Center for Curriculum Redesign, reflects on the implications of AI for learners, educators, and institutions. He raises a fundamental question: If AI can perform most tasks, what should humans focus on learning?

The discussion covers:

- The evolving role of curricula in an AI-saturated world
- The importance of ethics and human agency in engineering and education
- How AI is shaping the way we think, not just what we know
- Rethinking assessment, university entrance requirements, and the purpose of formal education

This interview offers a grounded and forward-looking perspective for anyone thinking seriously about the future of learning.
